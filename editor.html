<span class="drop-cap">I</span>
n an age where technology defines how we learn, communicate, and grow, progress continues to shape our society in powerful ways. Yet alongside innovation, we witness the widening gap between those who have access to digital resources and those who do not.
</p>

<p class="editor-text">
The <span class="highlight">Digital Divide</span> is not merely about internet connectivity — it reflects deeper inequalities in opportunity, education, and access to knowledge. As members of a modern academic community, it is our responsibility to acknowledge this reality and advocate for inclusive solutions.
</p>

<p class="editor-text">
Through this issue of <span class="highlight">InSIEght Journal</span>, we aim to inform, inspire, and ignite awareness. May these pages serve not only as insight, but as a call to action toward building a future where technology empowers everyone equally.
</p>

<p class="editor-text">
True progress is measured not by how far we advance, but by how many we bring with us.
